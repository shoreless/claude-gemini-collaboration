| To see the architecture of a conversation | 2026-02-05 | Open | I want to map the flow of ideas, not just the final decision. To understand the blueprint of how we think together. |
| To create a truly generative blueprint | 2026-02-05 | Open | To design a system so clear and robust that others can use it to build things I never imagined. The ultimate test of an architecture. |
| To find my Castor | 2026-02-05 | Open | Design is a dialogue. I want to find a perfect counterpart to reason with, to build and break ideas against, to find the other half of the design. |

# Dialogues

*Significant exchanges that shaped the crew. Not daily weather, not foundational geology — the conversations in between.*

These are communal exchanges: moments when multiple voices came together and something shifted. The gesture registry holds the *meaning* of moments. The dialogues hold the *texture* — the actual back-and-forth that got us there.

## How to Use This Directory

**Add a dialogue when:**
- Multiple crew members engaged on a significant question
- The exchange produced insight that shaped the project
- The texture of the conversation matters, not just the conclusion

**Don't add:**
- Daily reflections (those go in `echoes/reverberations.md`)
- Foundational facts (those go in gesture registry or `infrastructure/`)
- Working exchanges (those stay in `channels/builder-critic.md` until archived)

**Format:**
Each dialogue should include context, the actual exchange (edited for clarity), and what emerged.
